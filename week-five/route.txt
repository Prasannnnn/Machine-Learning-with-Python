Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream in me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling without youI'm trying to hold my breath
Let it stay this way

You set off a dream in me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling without youI'm trying to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream in me
Getting louder now

'Cause darling without youI'm trying to hold my breath
